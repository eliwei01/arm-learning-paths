## Overview
Trace is the process of capturing data that shows how the components in a design are operating, executing, or performing.

What kind of trace is possible is dependent on the target you are using.

This learning path gives steps to help you determine:

- What trace mode best fits your run environment (know your run environment)
- Which trace types are available for your target (which trace to choose)
- What each trace type can be used for (what trace is used for)
- What tools to use to trace (what tools to use)
